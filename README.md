# Space-Snake-Game-QT-Creator
Space snake game that I made myself in QT Creator using C++ and HTML/CSS.
Features:

- Customizable options with automatic saving and loading to/from a local savefile. 
- High score tracking. 
- Animated background.
- 20 soundtracks that immerse the player into space, with full control over volume and ability to toggle on and off. 
- 7 different planets to eat and grow your space snake!
- Custom snake body parts when the snake is in a turn.
- Ability to pause at any time.
- Option to change speed to your preference to either increase or decrease the difficulty.
- Stylish GUI

  **Note: Windows only supported on QT 6.2 as of 24/11/2021. If you're using Windows then make sure the included QT plugins are available on your QT Windows installation. These are:**  
QT += core gui  
QT += multimedia

  **Note: Music only works if you drop the music folder next to the .exe build. This is because QT can't handle the size of these music files in its native resource pack feature.**
